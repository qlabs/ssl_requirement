# SSL Requirement

This plugin is a nightmare to test on different versions of Rails.  The ability to test pull requests, and keep the package semi-up-to-date is taxing.  There has not been a new release since January 2010.  Long before I "took over" the repository.  There are plenty of forks which have far more functionality.  I am deprecating this repository.

## ForceSSL

Rails 3.1's [ForceSSL](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/force_ssl.rb) supersedes this repository.
